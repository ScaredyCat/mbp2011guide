<a id="issue"></a>
<h2>The issue(s)</h2>

This issue is the <i>"perfect storm"</i> of heat inside your Macbook Pro. The AMD Radeon cards released with this model of the MBP run hot in the first place, but other pieces of hardware inside the machine do as well -- hence the storm of heat. Also, Apple is using way too much <i>thermal paste</i> on these GPUs (<a href="http://www.sharkyforums.com/showthread.php?231756-Can-too-much-thermal-paste-gel-compound-grease-cause-CPU-to-overheat" target="_new">known to cause overheating</a>), <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Unibody+Early+2011+Teardown/4990#s22457" target="_new">see the picture here</a>!

<br />
<br />

These days the solder used to attach the GPU to the logic board on Macs is no longer lead (due to <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/rohs_eee/index_en.htm" target="new">environmental reasons</a>), and has a more <a href="http://www.sigcon.com/Pubs/news/10_01.htm" target="_new"><em>volatile</em> melting point</a> (i.e. a wider range of values that causes instability in the solder, essentially making it extremely &quot;brittle&quot;). With the GPU heating up & cooling down as you use the computer day-to-day, in time this will cause the solder to "crumble" or break and make the card unusable. <a href="http://www.sigcon.com/Pubs/news/10_01.htm" target="new">"Tin Whiskers"</a> could also be playing some role in this.




<hr />

<a id="symptoms"></a>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>

You will be working on your computer using a more GPU-intensive application (Google Maps, Safari, Photoshop, the list goes on...) or have an external display plugged in. Your computer may suddenly "blank" into horizontal lines:

<br /><br />

</center>

<br />

Your computer will restart. You may see a message that told you you had to restart. Your computer may restart and work normally. This pattern will continue until you get a "permanent failure" where you cannot boot past the Apple loading screen. After a permanent failure, different restart procedures will produce a (slightly) different result. <a href="http://youtu.be/l5kP6MF6fKY" target="_new">This video</a> shows you what to expect, and each case is written out below:

<ol>
<li /> <b>Normal startup:</b> Your computer will boot, show the Apple logo + pinwheel, and then go to a white/gray-ish screen and remain there. You must <i>force reboot</i> (hold the power buttond down).
<li /> <b>Safe mode startup:</b> While booting the computer hold the <tt>Shift</tt> key until you see the Apple logo + progress indicator. About 60% of the way through the progress indicator your computer will go to a blue screen with horizontal lines.
<li /> <b>Recovery mode startup:</b> While booting hold down <tt>Command</tt> + <tt>R</tt>. You should get to a screen that shows the option of which drive to boot from. Any selection will result in the same blue screen with horizontal lines as in the <i>Safe mode startup</i>.
<li /> <b>Console mode startup:</b> While booting hold down <tt>Command</tt> + <tt>S</tt> to boot in console mode. You might see distorted colors in your console (mine had blue lines, some have had red lines). We'll get back to how to use this mode to get your computer somewhat functional, but for now type <tt>sudo shutdown -h now</tt> to shutdown, or <tt>sudo reboot</tt>.
</ol>

<i>Early symptoms</i> include:
<ul>
<li /> Overheating when running graphics-intensive web sites, which causes the fans to loudly run
<li /> Random crashes with different solid-screen-colors showing up (black, blue, gray)
<li /> Random graphics glitches
<li /> Graphics distortions when plugging in an external monitor
</ul>

<font size="1"><i>Note that this in no way is conclusive testing / evidence to see if you are or are not affected by this bug. But if this is happening to you verbatim, it is likely your GPU.</i></font>

<h2>Document your case online</h2>

<ul>
<li /> <b>***<a href="http://www.apple.com/feedback/macbookpro.html" target="_new">Send Feedback to Apple</a>:***</b><br />
This is the most important. <b>IF</b> there is going to be a replacement program, you're going to have to start an official case with them. Might as well do it now. This will also help Apple diagnose the issue (we want a permanent fix, right?). They probably already have, but <b>officially document your case</b>!!!

<hr />
<a id="tempfix"></a>
<h2>Temporary fix</h2>

Since the issue is with the <i>AMD Radeon GPU</i> chip, you'll need to "trick" your computer to only use the <i>integrated Intel GPU</i> only. This can be accomplished by hiding (some or all of) the AMD GPU driver files from the system. I don't take credit for this solution, numerous sites and forum posts provide it. If you follow the directions explicitly this is a safe and reversible procedure. Also please note this is NOT NOT NOT a permanent fix. Your computer will still act up in fairly random ways, but at least you can boot it.

<ol>
<li /> <b>Start in console mode:</b> Start your computer holding <tt>Command</tt> + <tt>S</tt>
<li /> <b>Mount the hard drive:</b> Once there, type <tt>mount -uw /</tt>
<li /> <b>Create a backup directory:</b> From the root directory (where you should be), type:
	<br/>
	<tt>mkdir /Users/your_user_name/AMDDriverBackup</tt>
<li /> <b>Move the files:</b> To move all of the files type:
	<br />
	<tt>mv /System/Library/Extensions/ATI* /Users/your_user_name/AMDDriverBackup</tt>
    <br />
	<tt>mv /System/Library/Extensions/AMD* /Users/your_user_name/AMDDriverBackup</tt>
    <br /><br />
    Moving just two of the files initially worked for me, but I had to revert to moving all of them with time (not sure why). Moving just <tt>ATIRadeonX2000.kext</tt> and <tt>ATIRadeonX2000GLDriver.bundle</tt> were all it took.
<li /> <b>Restart:</b> Type <tt>sudo reboot</tt> to restart, or <tt>sudo shutdown -h now</tt> to shutdown.
</ol>

<center>
<img src="../img/mbp_directions.png">
</center>
<br />

You should now be able to boot your computer into a state where you can do basic web browsing and word processing. Most importantly, it's an easy way to get your files.

<br /><br />

Some recommend installing and using <a href="http://gfx.io/" target="_new">gfxCardStatus</a> and <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/23049/smcfancontrol" target="_new">smcFanControl</a> to help regulate your computer's fans & choice of graphics card. More details in the <a href="prevent">Fixed computer: Preventative steps</a> section.

<h3>Reverse above "fix"</h3>
To <b>reverse</b> the procedure above, simply repeat, <i>skip Step 3</i>, and change <i>Step 4</i> to:
<ul>
<li /><tt>mv /Users/your_user_name/AMDDriverBackup/A* /System/Library/Extensions</tt>
</ul>

<h3>File system check</h3>

Performing a file system check also helped get my computer booted at times:

<ol>
<li /> <b>Start in console mode:</b> Start your computer holding <tt>Command</tt> + <tt>S</tt>
<li /> <i>Mount the hard drive (Optional):</i> Type <tt>mount -uw /</tt> (Sometimes this produced slightly different results.)
<li /> <b>Perform check:</b> Type <tt>fsck -f</tt>
<li /> <b>Restart:</b> Type <tt>sudo reboot</tt> to restart, or <tt>sudo shutdown -h now</tt> to shutdown.
</ol>


<h3>PRAM reset</h3>

<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1379" target="_new">Resetting your PRAM</a> can help. To do so hold down <tt>Command</tt> + <tt>Option</tt> + <tt>P</tt> + <tt>R</tt> on bootup. 





<hr />
<a id="permfix"></a>
<h2>Permanent fix</h2>

You have several options to permanently fix your computer. It should be noted that the only true permanent solution is to <i>reball</i> your GPU, but keep reading before you do that.
<br />
<br />
I recommend taking the flat-rate repair and then attempt to recreate the issue until Apple replaces your computer with a newer model. This <a href="http://youtu.be/QRrUx3RbNl0?t=1m19s" target="new">video</a> outlines my sentiments.

<ol>
<li /> <b>Flat-rate repair [US only]:</b>
	<ul>
    <li /> The base rate is $310, but is actually ~$360 with shipping and taxes.
    <li /> They will replace any faulty parts on an out-of-warranty machine for this flat-rate cost.
    <li /> The whole process takes about 3 days.
    <li /> To get this option you can:
    	<ul>
        <li /> Go to an Apple store
        <li /> Call into customer service (if there are fees you can request an exception -- you'll get it)
        <li /> Email <a href="malto:tcook@apple.com" target="_new">Tim Cook</a> & wait for a call from executive relations.
        </ul>
    </ul>
<li /> <b>In-store repair:</b> You will be told that your logic board must be replaced, costing somewhere around $1000 in-store. <i>I was not offered the flat-rate repair option in-store, so you should absolutely ask about that if they give you this bad news.</i>
<li /> <b>Reflow or reball:</b>
	<ul>
	<li /> <i>Reflowing</i> is a process where you heat up your graphics card to remelt the solder. This can be done with a hairdryer or oven. I don't recommend this but you can Google it for instructions.
	<li /> <i>Reballing</i> is a permanent-fix option you have to fully resolve this issue without it likely reoccuring. Essentially they will replace your graphics card with a new one and use a stronger lead solder. This will cost about $200. Unfortunately, if you are hoping for a replacement program from Apple this will likely void your eligibility.
	</ul>
</ol>


<h3>EU Customers</h3>
EU customers are covered under the <a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/consumers/protection_of_consumers/l32022_en.htm" target="_new">EU Consumer Goods Law</a>. An Apple user "Barry the Fish" has reported to me that:
<ul>
<li /> They used the phrase "Consumer Law Coverage" when replacing his logic board for free.
<li /> On the second failure they used the phrase "Consumer Law Repeat Coverage"
<li /> After the second failure he received a (likely refurbished) "2014 Retina MBP 2.5GHz / 16GB RAM / 512GB flash / Iris Pro + NVIDIA GT750M with 2BG RAM"
<li /> His followup email had the subject line "APPLE DECLINED REPAIR-INT"
</ul>




<hr />
<a id="prevent"></a>
<h2>Preventative steps</h2>

If through any of the steps above you have been able to fix your computer you can take a few preventative steps to hopefully stop this issue from reoccuring.
<br /> <br />
Installing the following (free) programs can help:

<ul>
<li /> <b><a href="http://gfx.io/" target="_new">gfxCardStatus</a>:</b> This will allow for you to select whether you want to use only the <i>Integrated</i> or <i>Discrete</i> chip, or allow for the default <i>Dynamic</i> switching.
<li /> <b><a href="http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/23049/smcfancontrol" target="_new">smcFanControl</a>:</b> This will display your internal computer temperature and the fan rates in RPM. You have the option to turn the fans on a higher setting if you want.
</ul>

<hr />
<a id="stress"></a>
<h2>Stress testing</h2>

If you get your computer fixed by Apple you will receive a 90-day warranty. Since the real issue isn't fixed by swapping out the logic board, you may want to try to recreate the issue within the 90-day timeframe. My research indicates that EU customers get a replacement after the second failure, and US customers after the third.
<br/><br/>
Some of the GPU stress-testing applications I've toyed with are:
<ul>
<li /> <a href="http://unigine.com/products/heaven/" target="_new"><b>Heaven benchmark</b></a>
<li /> <a href="http://www.geeks3d.com/20130507/gputest-0-4-0-cross-platform-opengl-benchmark-released-opengl-4-tessellation-test-enabled-under-mac-osx/" target="_new"><b>GpuTest 0.4.0</b></a>
<li /> <a href="http://www.geeks3d.com/gputest/" target="_new"><b>GpuTest 0.6.0</b></a>
</ul>
I recommend the same <b>GpuTest</b> settings described by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/rossmanngroup" target="_new">Louis Rossmann</a> <a href="http://youtu.be/QRrUx3RbNl0" target="new">here</a>:
<ul>
<li /> You may want to disable your "energy saving" settings and the screensaver.
<li /> Run FurMark in "Fullscreen" mode with your computer's resolution and "8X MSAA antialiasing" turned on.
<li /> Either:
	<ul>
    <li /> <b>Run this continuously</b> until your computer fails
    <li /> <b>Run this before going to bed</b>, going to the store, etc...
    </ul>
<li /> The average failure rate after a logic board swap is 5-6 months (sampled only from people who have experienced a second failure).
<li /> <i>Really want to kill it?</i> Connect to an external monitor/TV and use GpuTest on both at once.
</ul>
